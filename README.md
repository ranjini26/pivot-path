## Inspiration
We’ve all seen it — people around us losing jobs because of automation or feeling stuck in careers they no longer enjoy. And while the internet is full of advice, most of it feels overwhelming and impersonal. We wanted to create something that doesn’t just throw information at you, but actually helps you take action. That’s where Pivot began — with a simple question: “What if people had a tool that helped them find clarity and direction in just 60 seconds?”

## What it does
Pivot is an AI-powered career companion for anyone who feels stuck, lost, or ready to change paths.
-You just type your current role (or upload your resume)
-Pivot suggests 3 new career paths matched to your skills
-It creates a 90-day free learning plan
-You get a checklist of tasks you can track
-You can even journal your journey to reflect and stay motivated
It’s like having a career coach, a planner, and a guide — all in one simple, text-based tool.

## How we built it
We built Pivot entirely in Lovable, using just the OpenAI API.
The logic is simple:
-We collect short user inputs (job role, resume, goals)
-Use GPT to analyze skills, suggest roles, and generate learning plans
-The UI is text-based and clean — to keep things focused and fast
-We layered in emotional elements like journaling and encouragement to keep the experience human, not robotic

## Challenges we ran into
-We had to balance being motivational without being vague or “too fluffy”
-Creating features like “Parallel You” (alternate future version) took careful thought — it had to feel inspiring, not unrealistic
-Keeping everything fast and frictionless in Lovable’s constraints
-Deciding what not to build — we had to strip away everything unnecessary to keep it truly simple

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
-Went from idea to working demo in under 48 hours
-People who tested it said, “Wow, this feels like something I actually needed.”
-We didn’t just build a tool — we built an experience that gives people hope and a path forward

## What we learned
-Less is more — when you’re solving a real problem, you don’t need fancy features
-AI becomes magical when it’s paired with empathy
-Most people don’t want 100 job listings — they want someone to say, “Here’s what makes sense for you.”

## What's next for Pivot
-Add more real-world success stories and role models
-Make the 90-day plan even more interactive
-Build a community feature where users can support each other
-Launch it publicly and help thousands of people realize: “You’re not stuck. You just need a Pivot.”
